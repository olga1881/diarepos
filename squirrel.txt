red squirrel
Today's image shows a Eurasian red squirrel perched in the snow, highlighting the thick winter coat 
and distinctive ear tufts that set this species apart. Native to forests across Europe and parts of Asia,
red squirrels depend on a varied diet of seeds, nuts, buds and fungi. To prepare for colder months, they 
scatter food stores across their territory and construct well-insulated nests — called dreys — inside tree 
hollows or high among branches.

Despite their reputation as garden raiders or urban 'nuisances,' squirrels play essential roles in local 
ecosystems. By burying seeds and failing to recover every cache, they unintentionally aid tree growth, 
particularly among conifers that rely on ground dispersal (рассеивание). Unlike animals that hibernate, red squirrels 
stay active throughout winter, timing their foraging trips between snowfalls and relying on memory and 
scent to locate hidden supplies. Their fur not only provides warmth but also improves camouflage against 
snowy backdrops.

Amur leopard cat, Russia
The leopard cat is a small wild cat found across South, Southeast and East Asia. 
Similar in size to a house cat but longer-legged and slenderer, it generally measures 
38–66 centimetres long, with a tail about 17–31 centimetres. 

Depending on the region, adults weigh roughly 0.55–7 kilograms. 
Their appearance varies widely: southern individuals tend to have warm golden coats, 
while those farther north often have pale grey fur that thickens for winter.

This species has several living subspecies, each adapted to its environment. 
These include the Bengal leopard cat found from India through Southeast Asia; 
the Javan, Sumatran and Bornean leopard cats on the islands of Indonesia; 
and the Taiwan leopard cat. 

One of the most distinctive is seen in today's image: 
the Amur leopard cat, found in the Russian Far East, Manchuria, Korea and nearby islands. 
It's larger and paler than its southern relatives, with features suited to cold, 
snowy forests.

Leopard cats are mostly nocturnal hunters, preying on rodents, birds, 
reptiles and amphibians. They're adaptable too, living in forests, wetlands, 
mountains and even agricultural landscapes across their wide range.
