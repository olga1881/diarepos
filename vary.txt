Karlovy Vary
In today's image, winter settles over Karlovy Vary in Czechia, a pastel valley that built its identity 
around the hot springs rising through its hills. The eponymous city traces its beginnings to accounts of 
Charles IV, then king of Bohemia (a historic region of Czechia) and later Roman Emperor, encountering 
a steaming pool here in the 14th century, an early moment that set this quiet part of Bohemia on the path 
to becoming a spa retreat.

As the town expanded along the Teplá and Ohře rivers, its character took shape: long colonnades, ornate 
facades and riverside hotels that reflected a calm, deliberate rhythm. Visitors from across 
Europe—aristocrats, writers, composers—came for the warm springs and the slower pace they offered, 
giving the city a personality rooted in routine, architecture and water.

That steady link to wellness earned Karlovy Vary a place among the Great Spa Towns of Europe in 2021, 
a UNESCO group recognising historic resort cities shaped by natural springs. Even in winter, the city 
holds a quiet confidence, its story still anchored to the water that first drew people into this valley.

Retiro Park, Madrid, Spain
Snowfall turns Retiro Park in Spain's capital, Madrid, into a winter postcard, with the Crystal Palace 
at its centre. Built in 1887 as a glass conservatory for the Philippines Exposition, this elegant 
iron-and-glass structure was inspired by London's Crystal Palace from the Great Exhibition of 1851. 
Designed by Spanish architect Ricardo Velázquez Bosco, the pavilion was intended to flood its interior 
with natural light, a feature that becomes especially striking when winter light filters through 
snow-dusted panes.

Set beside a small pond, the palace's reflection doubles the spectacle, turning the park into one 
of Madrid's most photogenic winter scenes. Today, the Crystal Palace serves as an exhibition space 
for the Museo Reina Sofía, Spain's national museum of modern and contemporary art, blending historic 
architecture with rotating contemporary installations in one of Madrid's most beloved green spaces.
